# TrackID silence gap time, In your recorders manual it should say how long
# it must be silent to trigger the auto StartID to be written (normaly 3 Sec
# so like my Panasonic SV-4100 only need 2 Sec, CHECK!!!)
# If you are using SIRCS dont worry about this
TGS=3
# Tape header, In the case of DAT it is required to have 2 min of silence to have room
# for the tape to streach over time and to protect the first track. Failure to do this
# will result in currupted audio between the 00:00:00 to 00:02:00 ABS time.
# For MiniDisc you can set this to 0s becuase this does not apply
